      <h1>How Skysense is Different</h1>
        <p>
        Good Work.
        We do good work because we believe it has meaning and it makes an impact.
        We don't waste time doing bad work like long emails, excessive meetings, or micromanagement.
        </p><p>
        Impact.
        We solve problems that impact society, to change the world and help people’s lives.
        If you believe in positive change, everyone else can too. Our projects are things we are happy to work on.
        </p><p>
        Autonomy.
        People work long hours because they’re passionate not because they have to.
        We don't micromanage. We set goals without dictating tasks for high individual level of autonomy.
        </p><p>
        Fail Frequently.
        We don’t blame people for mistakes, but rather encourage it because good work requires taking risks.
        We believe in taking risks by trying many controlled experiments and failing frequently.
        </p><p>
        Freedom. 
        We have a flat organizational structure with a 4-day work week and we embrace remote work.
        We don't squander human potential with by jobs or offices that people hate.
