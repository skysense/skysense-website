*Skysense, a leader in agricultural technology, took center stage at the collaborative [Oregon State University (OSU) and Washington State University (WSU) Hemp Field Days](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7079538869225869312?updateEntityUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_feedUpdate%3A%28V2%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7079538869225869312%29), held on July 25 and 26, 2023. The event, which attracted professionals and enthusiasts from the hemp industry, provided a platform for Skysense to demonstrate its innovative use of drones and AI in plant disease detection.*

The Field Days, hosted at OSU-Pendleton and WSU-Prosser research centers, offered participants insights into various aspects of hemp cultivation, including irrigated and dryland fiber and grain trials, essential oil variety trials, nitrogen management, and dual-purpose production systems. Attendees had the opportunity to explore current pest and disease issues while touring Columbia Basin Bioscience's production fields and processing facility in Oregon, along with a visit to a commercial hemp field in Washington.

Skysense's contribution to the event was met with enthusiasm as they showcased their advanced technology in drone-based plant disease detection, focusing specifically on identifying male hemp plants. The use of drones, in collaboration with Skysense, not only allowed for the identification of rare male hemp plants but also enabled the mapping of weed populations.

In addition to drone technology, Skysense expressed interest in utilizing laser weeders to target and destroy weed populations, ensuring a robust stand for over-seeded hemp. This commitment to leveraging state-of-the-art solutions aligns with Skysense's dedication to advancing precision agriculture and promoting sustainable farming practices.

The event not only highlighted Skysense's technological prowess but also underscored the company's commitment to contributing to the evolution of the hemp industry. As a pioneer in the intersection of agriculture and technology, Skysense continues to lead the way in providing innovative solutions for the challenges faced by modern hemp farmers.
