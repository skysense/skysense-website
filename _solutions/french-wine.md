At Skysense, we are passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technology to revolutionize agriculture, and our recent collaboration with a renowned vineyard in the south of France has been a testament to the transformative power of drone imagery, satellite data, and artificial intelligence in the world of wine production.

**Mapping the Future of Vineyard Management:**

In 2023, Skysense embarked on an exciting journey with a prestigious vineyard in the heart of the picturesque South of France. Our mission? To showcase the capabilities of drone and satellite imagery combined with advanced AI solutions in addressing the unique challenges faced by vineyard owners and managers.

**Orthophotos: A Window into Precision:**

Our team captured high-resolution orthophotos, providing an unparalleled view of the vineyard's terrain. This detailed imagery laid the foundation for an in-depth analysis of the vineyard's layout, helping the owners and managers gain insights into the topography, identify potential problem areas, and optimize their overall operational strategy.

**Plant Counting: Enhancing Efficiency:**

Skysense's advanced AI algorithms went to work, not only creating detailed maps but also accurately counting the number of plants in the vineyard. This information proved invaluable for resource planning, ensuring that the vineyard's workforce was optimized for maximum efficiency.

**Detecting Plant Disease: Proactive Protection:**

One of the primary challenges in viticulture is the threat of plant diseases that can impact grape quality and yield. Skysense utilized AI to detect early signs of plant disease, providing the vineyard with a powerful tool to take proactive measures and prevent the spread of infections. This early intervention can make a significant difference in preserving the health of the vineyard and, ultimately, the quality of the wine produced.

**Irrigation Management: Sustainable Practices:**

Our collaboration extended to optimizing irrigation management. By analyzing the imagery and satellite data, Skysense helped the vineyard identify areas of over- or under-irrigation, contributing to water conservation efforts and promoting sustainable viticulture practices.

**The Skysense Difference:**

Our work with the South of France vineyard exemplifies the Skysense commitment to empowering vineyard owners and managers with the tools they need to make informed decisions. The marriage of drone imagery, satellite data, and AI technology opens up new possibilities for precision agriculture in the wine industry.

**Looking Ahead:**

As we reflect on this collaboration, we are excited about the future of vineyard management. Skysense continues to innovate, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in agriculture. We invite vineyard owners and managers to explore the transformative potential of our solutions, tailor-made for the unique challenges of wine production.
