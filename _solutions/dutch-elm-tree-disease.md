## Detect and Map Dutch Elm Tree Disease with Skysense

**Understanding Dutch Elm Tree Disease:**
Dutch Elm Tree Disease, caused by the fungus Ophiostoma ulmi, poses a significant threat to elm trees worldwide. It spreads through elm bark beetles, leading to the rapid decline and eventual death of infected trees. The disease is characterized by wilting leaves, branch dieback, and ultimately, the loss of majestic elm trees from landscapes and forests.

**The Problem and the Importance of Detection:**
Dutch Elm Tree Disease is a critical problem for landowners, city tree management, forest managers, and governments. The disease can quickly devastate entire elm tree populations, negatively impacting biodiversity, aesthetics, and the environmental benefits provided by these iconic trees. Early detection and intervention are vital to prevent the further spread of the disease and preserve the elm tree heritage in our landscapes.

**The Challenge: Detecting and Identifying Diseased Trees:**
Detecting and identifying Dutch Elm Tree Disease poses significant challenges. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection, which can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Additionally, the vast areas to be covered and the hidden nature of the disease within the tree's vascular system make it difficult to identify infected trees promptly. This is where advanced technology and AI play a crucial role.
